# Football Simulator 
[![Build Status](http://drone.zoxexivo.com/api/badges/ZOXEXIVO/football-simulator/status.svg)](http://drone.zoxexivo.com/ZOXEXIVO/football-simulator)

Attempt to implement Sigames Football Manager simulation engine without manual control.

Site: **[football-simulator.org](https://football-simulator.org)**

It is **not gamable** right now and I need a lot of work to make it workable.

Currently, most of elements are subs, but I change it step by step

Currently available nation for simulation - **Russia**

I use only Askama templates to render UI and it was my decision, because i want to run my simulation only with one command:

**cargo run**

without **npm intstall** and other annoying things :)
